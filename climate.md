<details> <summary>Asotronomical Climate systems</summary>

- Controlled by the sun and earth's orbit
- Sunspots, solar flares, solar wind
- More sunspots means more solar energy (UV Rays)



Milankovitch Cyles:
- Changes in eccentricity, 100,000 year cycles
    - Perihelion is closest to the sun
    - Aphelion is furthest from the sun
- Axial precession (wobble) 26,000 year cycles
- Obliquity (tilt) 41,000 year cycles
    - Summer solstice is minimum tilt
    - Winter solstace is maximum tilt
    - Autumnal & Vernal Equanox is near zero tilt


Solar Declanation
- Zenith (degrees away from vertical line)
- Azumuth (north south angle measured from ground)
- Altitude
- Affected by
    - Latitude
    - Time of day
    - Time of year

<details> <summary>Atmosphere</summary>

Origin of the Atmosphere
- Almost entirely CO2 & water vapor
- Almost no oxygen




Thermosphere
- hot on top
- cold on bottom
- mesopause at bottom

Mesosphere
- cold on top
- hot on bottom
- meteors burn up here
- Stratopause at bottom

Stratosphere
- hot on top
- cold on bottom
- maximum ozone here
- tropopause at bottom

Troposphere
- hot on bottom
- cold on top




Nitrogen Cycle
- 78% of the atmosphere is nitrogen


</summary> </details>


<details> <summary>Climate Change</summary>


Greenhouse effect
- CO2 absorts solar radiation
- Traps heat

Methane
- 28x more heat absorbing than co2
- 9 years in atmosphere before absorption

Water vapor
- Weather is the water cycle. 

Particulates
- Solid dust





PV = nRT

P is the pressue of the gas 
V Is the volume of the gas
T is the temperature of the gas
N is the number of miles
 R is the gas constant

 $l \atm k^{-1} mol^{-1}$

<hr>

## Non-greenhouse gasses
Nitrogen cycle
- Nitrification is a microbial process where amonia oxidises
- Denitrification is where nitrates become nitrogen gas


Oxygen cycle
- 21% of the atmosphere is oxygen
- Plants convert co2 to oxygen
- People convert oxygen to co2

<details> <summary>Heat</summary>


Stephan-Boltzman law
$P = \sigma T^4$


Wein's law
$\lambda max = \frac{2897}{T}$






Long wave Lengths - $10^2 - 10^6$ </br>

Short wave lengths - $10^{22} - 10^{24}$


Latent Heat
- The temperature (or energy) at which a phase change occurs



Heat of Fusion - Heat necessary to completely melt a solid into a liquid
Heat of vaporization - heat necessary to vaporize liquid into gas

vapor pressure - Pressure exerted by water molucules in the atmosphere 
- Dalton's law



dew point - temperature at which saturation occurs
- Where there's enough cloud water for rain to start



</summary> </details>



<details> <summary>Humidity</summary>





Subsidence Inversion - Slow sinking air
Frontal Inversion
- Warm air and layerd clouds 
Nocurnal Inverson
Tropopause Inversion`


Relative humidity
- Ammount of water vapor relative to saturation
- Ratio: quantity over density
- q/d




Dryness index




AMT

NSP - Normal summer precipitation

NAP - Annual preceipitation





A - 18c or higher </br>
B. 70% or more annual precipitation



</summary> </details>


<details> <summary>Clouds</summary>


Convective CUrrents - Warm air rises, cool air sinks.


Frontal - A cold front pushes warm air upward.

Orographic - Mountains create a barrior or 'rain shadow' which keeps the rain away.

Convergent - Surface low pressure systems attract warmer air, which all rises in the same spot.



High clouds
- Cirrus
- - Cirrocumulus
- Cirrostratus

Middle Clouds
= Altostratus
Altocumulus
cumulonimbus


Low clouds
- Stratocululus
- Cumulus
- Stratus
- Nimbostratus



Asperatas cloud - created by instability in the atmosphere, lots of air flows </br>
Mamatus - Quickly decenting cold air, usually occur after a storm </br>
Wall cloud - Decending turbuland air, causes tornados  </br>
Shelf cloud - on the front end of a thunderstorm, caused by high winds </br>





- Cirus or ciro means 'high'
- Alto means medium
- Strato means low
- Nimbo means rain
- Cumulus is like a collection of small clouds


- Softer rounded edges mean a shrinking cloud
- Sharper jagged edges mean a growing cloud


</summary> </details>



Adiabatic process
- No heat transfers
- Warm set of air rises
